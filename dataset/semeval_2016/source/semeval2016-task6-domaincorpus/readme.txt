SemEval-2016 Task 6 Domain Corpus
====================

In the weakly supervised framework (task B), the systems will be tested on one target domain 'Donald Trump' for which no manually labeled training data will be provided. However, we provide a domain corpus for this target domain. This corpus has been collected by searching tweets with hashtags #DonaldTrump and #trump2016.

The domain corpus is distributed via tweet IDs. The participants can download the tweets composing the domain corpora by using the provided script. Please note that due to Twitter's limits it takes about 5 days to download the corpus. Also, some tweets may be unavailable if their authors deleted the tweets. 


Semeval Twitter data download script
====================

The download script has been adapted from Alan Ritter's script: https://github.com/aritter/twitter_download.

For downloading tweets distributed using IDs to protect privacy.  Uses the following format: one tweet ID per line. 

Prerequisites:
--------------
[sixohsix/twitter](https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter)

```
easy_install twitter
```

Usage:
--------------

The first time you run this, it should open up a web browser, have you log into Twitter, and show a PIN number for you to enter into a prompt generated by the script.

1. Login to Twitter with your user name in your *default* browser.

2. Run the script like this to download your credentials: `python download_tweets_api.py --dist=Donald_Trump.txt --output=downloaded_Donald_Trump.txt`

3. Download tweets like so: 
```
python download_tweets_api.py --dist=Donald_Trump.txt --output=downloaded_Donald_Trump.txt
```


Restarting after a partial download:
--------------
In case the script hangs in the middle of the download for whatever reason, use the --partial argument to specify the file containing partially downloaded results.  
This way you won't have to start from scratch again:

```
python download_tweets_api.py --dist=Donald_Trump.txt --partial=downloaded_Donald_Trump.txt --output=downloaded_Donald_Trump2.txt
```


Notes:
--------------
- You may need to manually change the link that is printed out for authorization to use https:// instead of http://
- The time on your computer needs to be set accurately.  Thanks to Canberk for noting this on the email list.
